<h3>Why Adoption?</h3>
<p> By adopting a pet from an animal shelter or rescue group, you'll help save the lives of two animals—the pet you adopt and a homeless animal that can be rescued because of space you make available.Our animal shelter has plenty of healthy, well-behaved animals waiting for a home.You'll also have a friend and a life companion in one. </p>
<h3>Why to Foster?</h3>
<p>Fostering is the most effective way to reduce overcrowding in shelters, thus preventing killings and opening space for more animals to be saved.Foster homes help with socialization, behavioral problems and help pets be ready for adoption. Someone fostering a pet can help with feeding, grooming, health controls, vaccinations, and taking the pet to medical appointments.Fostering pets is a win-win situation that benefits everyone involved. First, it helps local shelters maintain levels of animals and accept more animals. Secondly, it allows the pets to live in a real home while they wait for adoption. Third, foster parents can enjoy the joy and pleasure of helping a pet in need.  </p>
<h3>How to Donate?</h3>
<p>By donating you can help our organisation to grow.We can save even more homeless animals and open our doors to more opportunities.Donating helps with taking care of our animals,supplying food for them and it helps with paying their medical bills.There are a few ways to donate. Firstly, you can donate to our bank account: First Home 1234 5678 9876 5432, Halkbank.Secondly, you can email a check to our e-mail:<u><a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">firsthomeorganisation@gmail.com</a> </u>.And lastly,there are boxes placed around our town and in mostly Tinex supermarkets.Your help is greatly appreciated. </p>
